# Notice 
This repo holds code snippets and examples worked on while taking the Object Oriented Programming Module in University of Westminster.
By no means will this represent the content of the course. This repo simply holds what I attempted and pushed in.
If interested please look into the University [overview](https://www.westminster.ac.uk/sites/default/public-files/programme-specifications/Software-Engineering-BEng-Honours-2019-20_0.pdf) on the course to get a proper idea.
